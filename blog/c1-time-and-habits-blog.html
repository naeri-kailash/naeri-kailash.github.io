    <h1>Time and Habits</h1>
      <h2>which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h2>
        <p>Meditation has always been a part of my life as I come from a family that practises Buddhism
          which strongly encourages meditation as a daily practice. Although I do not always manage to
          maintain a routine of daily meditation, the concept of mindfulness is always very present for me.
          As of yet I have not tried any of the new techniques, however I find the idea of the pomodoro
          technique very interesting and would like to try it. I think this will be positive as I tend
          to immerse myself into study for long periods and then struggle to find the motivation to get
          back into it again that day.
        </p>
      <h2>what did you find interesting?</h2>
        <p>I found the idea of forcibly taking breaks even when you are in a 'flow' very interesting.
          It goes against how I study intuitively and I would like to see what kind of effect it has on my
        productivity.</p>
      <h2>what worked for you?</h2>
        <p>Meditation is pretty great. Otherwise I am yet to discover the other techniques!</p>
      <h2>which will you experiment further with?</h2>
        <p>Pomodoro technique.</p>
