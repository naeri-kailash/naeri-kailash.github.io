            <h3> Have you tried using any of the insight and techniques for growing trust and sincerity? How did it go?</h3>
              <p>
                I haven't attempted these exercises.
              </p>
            <h3> Try empathic listening - how did it go?</h3>
               <p>
                 Empathetic listening is something I have aimed to maintain since I was quite young. Perhaps because I saw this skill missing in most
                 people I wished to be able to provide this as I knew how meaningful it was. Feeling understood is very moving and healing
                 and I have recieved a lot of positive feedback from people who have felt I have listened empathetically. Although it is a fantastic
                 skill it can also be very draining. I used to do it a lot but over the last few years I came to realise I was giving too much in this
                 was and started to also have boundaries to protect myself as well.
               </p>
            <h3> How did you find the loving kindness meditation?</h3>
              <p>
                This is a lovely meditation technique and definitely has a really positive effect on your own mental state in
                the long run as you are training yourself to observe and understand people in a different way from usual. Rather than
                judging people based on your own criteria you learn to try and understand people from a perspective that makes their story
                and actions make more sense.
