             <h3>How does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS?</h3>
                <p>
                  HTML is like the skeleton and is used to categorise and define the types of information you are inputting.
                  CSS is in a sense dressing the skeleton, depending on how you use CSS the webpage can look entirely different despite having the same HTML.
                  Javascript provides interactive functionality on webpages.
                </p>
             <h3>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'.</h3>
                <p>
                  Control flow: Code will generally run from top to bottom. Times when this flow is
                  interrupted are when functions are called and loops are started.
                </p>
                <p>
                   Loops: Loops take an initialization statement which is only executed once before the loop
                   starts, this could be likened to putting the toothpaste on your toothbrush...
                   Once the toothpaste is on/ the loop has been initialised, the loop begins to execute.
                   There is a condition statement that is evaluated before each loop is executed, including
                   the first loop. If the condition is found to be false e.g. /'teeth are not dirty/',
                    the loop will not execute. If the condition is found to be true e.g. /'teeth ARE
                    dirty/', the loop will continue to iterate. Each time the condition is found to be
                    false, ie at the end of each loop, the final-expression is executed before the next
                    iteration begins. E.g. each time teeth are found still to be dirty, the toothbrushing
                    will continue to execute.
                </p>
             <h3>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h3>
                <p>
                  Arrays: With arrays you can store multiple values/pieces of data in one variable,
                  however this information is not /'categorical/'.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Objects: With objects you can great categories of informations to your liking.
                  Is it a simple way of storing complex combinations of information. e.g. information
                  about an album. Objects can have arrays in the which adds to the benefits of organising
                  complex information.
                </p>
             <h3>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</h3>
                <p>
                  Funtions are designed to be able to process information is ways designed by the developer.
                   They are useful as they can take input from the user and process information in real time
                   depending on what the user inputs.
