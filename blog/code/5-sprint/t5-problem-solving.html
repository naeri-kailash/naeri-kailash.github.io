                     <li>
                        </le><strong>What was the problem?</strong>\n
                        I forgot to add the bracket notation when calling an array variable

                        <strong>What problem solving techniques did you use?</strong>\n

                        Initially very frustrated, but ultimately it was a great learning

                     <li>
                        <strong>What did you learn?</strong>\n
                        That even if there is only one variable you must always use bracket notation when calling an array!

             <h3>Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process:</h3>
                <p>
                     I have found a lot of techniques useful in times where I have hit a road block.
                     Pseudocoding is particularly helpful as if is a good way to nut out the logic you will be using
                     and weeding out extra bits while adding things that are missing. It is also a good way to reflect
                      on weather the approach you are using is the most straightforward/ logical one.
                     Using the developer tools in chrome has also proven incredibly helpful, especically when there
                     is a bug you can't quite put your finger on.
                     Ultimately though, when you have gone through all of the motions and still can't quite figure a bug
                     out, the best thing you can do get get a pair of fresh eyes to look the code over. This can also be
                     great for getting tips on other ways you could go about solving a problem.

             <h3>.map() .filter() and .reduce() functions and what they do</h3>
                <p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      .map()  - this creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element
                      in the original array, eg the function may multiply each element by 2 so the new array will have
                      the multiplied numbers while the original array remains unchanged.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      .filter()  - can filter the contents of an array and output the elements that pass the 'test' which you can input as a function the the brackets.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      .reduce()  - reduces the array to a single value. It executes the provided function for each value of the array (from left-to-right). Subsequently the return value of the function is stored in an accumulator (result/total).
                    </li>
                  </ul>
