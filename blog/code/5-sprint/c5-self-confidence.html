             <h3>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</h3>
                 <p>
                    Mindfulness is in a sense increasing how observant you are about things taking place within and outside of your self.
                    It may bring you more in tune with your breath, your physical position and bodily reactions to internal and external
                    stimuli and perhaps most importantly your emotional reactions to these event. If you think of the mind as something akin
                    to a wild monkey, climbing and swinging through it trees without a care in the world, mindfulness in developing an ability
                    to observe this monkey in all its states. This is where mindfulness becomes self awareness. Self awareness is an incredibly
                    important and undervalued skill that can vastly change an individuals life and wellbeing. Mindfulness could go from something
                    as mundane as realising you are about to bite into that sumptuous piece of cake that you promised yourself you wouldn't eat, knowing
                    why you were about to do it and perhaps even having the power to put the cake down. Or it could range to catching yourself before
                    making unnecessary nasty comments towards someone or stopping yourself before throwing your phone to the ground in frustration. Having the self control in said
                    situations is only a side effect of mindfulness where the primary result is self awareness - being able to see your emotions and their causes as the arise and subside.
                 </p>
             <h3>Try at least one of the self awareness practices. What was your experience of it?</h3>
                 <p>
                      <strong>Journalling:</strong> I found this exercise very interesting as it almost feels like it is prompting you to write things
                      you would normally filter out as you do not have the time to contemplate whether to accept or reject an idea so you simply have to write it.
                      It can bring up some seemingly random things that following contemplation and make a lot of sense and actually be quite useful.
                 </p>
             <h3>What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?</h3>
                 <p>
                    I found it very interesting as it offered some methods of mindfulness/ self awareness practice that I was not
                    familiar with. I did a little of each but would really like to explore them both further.
