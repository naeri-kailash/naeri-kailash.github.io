            <h3>What is your experience of compassionate (or not) leadership?</h3>
              <p>
                 I have had experience with horrifyingly terrible management and wonderful
                 nurturing management so this is a topic I can really identify with. My most
                 negative experience was working in a cafe where amongst many things, the manager
                 was verbally quite vicious and unpredictable. Basically whatever you did it could
                 never be good enough. He had no issues with yelling at me and was very hypocritical.
                 It was a shocking experience for me as I had never had someone treat me in such a
                 way so it took me 2 months of this treatment to actually react appropriately and
                 leave the job. In terms of my work performance it certainly was not positive as
                 I could not stand being at work. The only thing that made it bearable was the
                 other awesome staff I was working with though I don't believe they were aware of
                 what was happening. I found the job itself enjoyable and know that with good management
                 it would have been a very different experience. <br />
                 My positive work experience was really quite a wonderful chapter of my life. I worked
                 for 2 years at a special school as a teacher aide where everyone in the staff was treated
                 as equals. We were all valuable and we were made to feel that way. Because of this our love
                 for the job was able to thrive and we could perform at our utmost because our spirit was not
                 being squashed by a nasty work environment.

            <h3>Do the multiplying goodness and Tonglen meditations. How did you find them?</h3>
               <p>
                These are very beautiful and calming styles of meditation that I greatly enjoy. I definitely
                get a sensation of happiness from them.

            <h3>How does the SCARF model apply to your Phase 0 experience so far? How will it apply to bootcamp?</h3>
              <p>
                S - Status - 'Competing' against oneself (increasing your own skill set) is the most benicial
                and least socially damaging way to increase your status. <br />
                C - Certainty - Uncertainty effects productivity as it will distract the mind until resolved.
                Removing uncertainty allows us to focus wholly on the important matters at hand. I
                have not struggled with uncertainty in phase 0 as I am 100% certain that I want
                to persue this path as hard as it may be.<br />
                A - Autonomy - Feeling helpless in the face of stress is what creates great struggle for me
                learning programming. Trying to overcome this by taking control and having
                autonomy by being able to seek solutions to overcome these issues can prove challenging. Asking
                for help has usually been the best way for me to overcome this issue.<br />
                R - Relatedness - This has not felt relevant so far in the course. Though I'm sure I don't
                feel any of my course buddies are foes!<br />
                F - Fairness - ...

            <h3>Have a difficult conversation. How did it go?</h3>
               <p>
                 1. Prepare by walking through the “three conversations.”<br />
                 2. Decide whether to raise the issue.<br />
                 3. Start from the objective “third story.”<br />
                 4. Explore their story and yours.<br />
                 5. Problem solve.<br />
                 I don't personally use this approach however generally in my life I have managed to
                 effectively carry out difficult conversations.
