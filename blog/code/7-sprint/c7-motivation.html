            <h3>How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?</h3>
              <p>
                I live my life quite spontaneously, I don't have a habit of planning things
                too thoroughly/ if at all. In this sense it could appear that I rely on pleasure
                a lot for happiness but on reflection I have come to understand this is not entirely
                accurate. I put a great importance in listening to my conscience and not wasting
                time on things that will not prove beneficial for myself and others. For example I have
                had employment in various fields - one of which I could not stand being retail - feeling
                like I was trying to coerse people into buying things they did not want or need. However when
                working with children and adults with special needs I have felt very inspired and happy
                in my work environment as I felt that my energy was going into something invaluable. Helping
                those who really needed it. In this I found purpose. I hope to hold on to that value in future
                employment.
              </p>
            <h3> From the 'discovering values and higher purpose' exercise, \n
             What are your core values? \n
             What do you stand for?</h3>
               <p>
                Never doing things at the expense of others or the environment. For this reason I am a vegan
                as I do not believe it is justifiable to eat animal or fish products when it both takes lives
                and damages the environment. In the same way I try to live my life in a way that doesn't take
                advantage of or harm others, rather has a beneficial impact. This is difficult to achieve in a lot
                of ways considering how society is set up, and how we often do not know where products really come from
                but we can do our best can't we. I look forward to having a skillset I can put to use in places where
                I can can greater impact, for example in an NGO.
               </p>
            <h3>How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?</h3>
              <p>
                I found it a very interesting approach as generally my meditative practise has not had a focus in
                that sense. It was a great way to neutralize feelings about instances of success and failure and
                find a comfortable a healthy middle ground.
