             <h3>How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</h3>
                <p>
                  It is good to be reminded not to get caught up in minor details at this point. Getting an understanding of fundamental aspects of
                  programming and the layers we must use is the key right now for learning this vast amount of information in a short time.
                </p>
             <h3>What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2?</h3>
                <p>
                  I am very familiar with meditation and different techniques as I have done a lot of study and practice in
                  this area due to my background in Buddhism. I know it is amazing and incredibly beneficial and it is great to see it being spoken about
                  in the tech world.
                </p>
             <h3>What new things have you learnt about meditation?</h3>
                <p>
                  I have learnt more about how it activates the brain and the immune system. I knew about this vaguely before
                  but it was interesting and very encouraging to be presented with the results of research in the area.
                </p>
             <h3>Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?</h3>
                <p>
                  I found the concept of waiting a few breaths between experiencing a stimulus, and reacting very
                  interesting and positive. I have not come across this method before and feel that it is a very good
                  habit for people to form, especially those who are quick to react in regretful ways.
