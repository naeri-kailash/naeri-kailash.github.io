          <h1>Time and Habits</h1>
            <h2>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h2>
              <p>Meditation has always been a part of my life as I come from a family that practises Buddhism
                which strongly encourages meditation as a daily practice. Although I do not always manage to
                maintain a routine of daily meditation, the concept of mindfulness is always very present for me.
                As of yet I have not tried any of the new techniques, however I find the idea of the pomodoro
                technique very interesting and would like to try it. I think this will be positive as I tend
                to immerse myself into study for long periods and then struggle to find the motivation to get
                back into it again that day.
              </p>
            <h2>What did you find interesting?</h2>
              <p>I found the idea of forcibly taking breaks even when you are in a 'flow' very interesting.
                It goes against how I study intuitively and I would like to see what kind of effect it has on my
              productivity.</p>
            <h2>What worked for you?</h2>
              <p>Meditation is pretty great. Otherwise I am yet to discover the other techniques!</p>
            <h2>Which will you experiment further with?</h2>
              <p>Pomodoro technique.</p>
